# Medical-Image-Segmentation
Automatic segmentation of medical images is an important step to extract useful information that can help doctors make a diagnosis.  We have build the U-Net model for medical image segmentation and performance analysis of the model trained using limited annotated data. Main purpose of our project is to build automatic medical image segmentation model, make the system generalized and monitor the performance of the model with respect to size of dataset and number of epochs.

Problem definition: 
Building the U-Net model for medical image segmentation and performance analysis of the model trained using limited annotated data.

Aim and Objectives of the Project: 
1.To build an automatic medical image segmentation model using U-Net.
2.To train the model using limited annotated dataset.
3.To analyze the accuracy of a model with the different digital images.
4.To analyze the generalizability of the model using different datasets.

Scope of the Project: 
Segmentation is an important tool in medical image processing, and it has been useful in many applications.The applications include detection of the coronary border in angiograms, multiple sclerosis lesion quantification, surgery simulations, surgical planning, measurement of tumor volume and its response to therapy, functional mapping, automated classification of blood cells, study of brain development, detection of microcalcifications on mammograms, image registration, atlas-matching, heart image extraction from cardiac cineangiograms, detection of tumors etc.

Limitations of the Project: 
● The input image size should not be less than 512 X 512. 
● Performance is affected by the presence of noise which may have a negative influence on segmentation results.
